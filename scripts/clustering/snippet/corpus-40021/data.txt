A strong earthquake has shaken parts of Central America and Southern Mexico leaving 63 people dead. As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, there was widespread damage throughout El Salvador. A landslide caused by the earthquake buried some 200 houses in a ravine West of the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador and rescue workers are digging frantically trying to unearth victims. Alex Ronderos, who works for The Los Angeles Times in San Slavador, tells VOA that there may be hundreds of dead at that site

In the southeastern town of San Miguel, the wall of a hospital collapsed and 25 people were known to be dead in a small village nearby. News of the damage was slowed by the fact that much of El Salvador's telephone service and electricity was knocked out by the quake for several hours. Only sketchy reports had arrived from many hard-hit areas. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee and possibly others worshipping inside, according to the Rev. Robert Castro. The Red Cross reported that 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Some 200 other victims were rushed to the area hospital, which authorities weren't sure was still structurally sound

Rescuers using sticks and their bare hands dug for survivors in buried homes after a powerful earthquake struck El Salvador and Guatemala, killing at least 81 people and leaving hundreds more missing. About 1,200 people were unaccounted for in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of El Salvador's capital and at least 79 people are known to be dead across the country, a National Emergency Committee announced. Two people died in Guatemala. Police and rescuers in El Salvador put the toll from Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake at a slightly higher figure of around 100 confirmed dead and said they feared the number could rise as excavations continued

Offers of assistance came from Spain, Taiwan, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered damage _ and two deaths _ in the Saturday quake. National Police and rescue groups said 150 bodies had been recovered from Las Colinas alone by midday _ but in the post-quake chaos, rescuing took precedence over accurate counting. The National Emergency Committee reported 193 dead, 350 injured and 1,000 missing nationwide _ though its toll of the dead from Las Colinas was 60 less than the number of bodies from the same area reported by the city morgue.

The official death toll now stands at six hundred but four thousand people are still listed as missing. In the town of Komasagua three thousand people were missing and feared buried under a massive landslide. Relief worker Steve Matthews of the United States says filling basic human needs is priority number one. We give them plastic sheeting and cooking utensils and then also look after their immediate food needs giving them beans and rice and so on. One of the major needs is going to be fresh water, even the water pipes in San Salvador have been cracked and broken so fresh water is hard to come by. By midday Monday 270 bodies had been retrieved from the Las Calenas neighborhood of Santa Tegla, a small town near the capital San Salvador

Today they pulled out nine bodies or only portions of bodies unfortunately and they are not finding any people alive and hope is fading very, very quickly that there're going to be anymore survivors found. The earth that's covered homes in its area in Las Colinas where there is a landslide, is quite compacted and the chance of finding someone alive is really almost impossible, although people always do have that hope

But yes, family members keep dropping by the morgue area to see if there's been bodies found that they can identify as perhaps one of their loved ones and they are hovering in nearby though like I said, hope is dwindling fast.

Hopes dwindled Monday for finding more survivors trapped under tons of earth in a suburb here after the earthquake on Saturday set off a landslide. The death toll increased. Officials said that by their estimates more than 500 people had been killed, and some reports said the number still missing was as high as 4,000. Many of the dead were in Las Colinas, a suburban neighborhood of Santa Tecla where a housing development was obliterated by a wall of earth that came crashing down a hillside

El Salvador's president said 3,000 coffins were expected to arrive from Colombia on Tuesday, and workers continued to bury unidentified bodies in common graves at Santa Tecla's municipal cemetery. As information began to trickle in from the countryside, where hundreds of communities remain almost completely cut off from the outside world, the president said workers had recovered 609 bodies in El Salvador and were searching for hundreds more. At least six people were killed in neighboring Guatemala. President Francisco Flores said 2,412 people were injured and more than 45,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in Saturday's magnitude-7.6 quake. In a televised address to the nation Monday night, he said he expected the death toll to rise significantly and that 3,000 coffins would arrive Tuesday from Colombia, a major exporter of coffins in the region

The biggest challenge which we are addressing right now and I believe successfully with the landslides, a lot of the roads out of the city to out of the outlined towns and other parts of the country were cut off. So we couldn't get in to do assessments, disaster assessments. We couldn't get in to deliver supplies. We were initially doing airdrops of food and emergency supplies and now, as you know, we are a couple of days out. Roads are starting to open up, so we are able to take trucks in to the outline communities that have been affected
