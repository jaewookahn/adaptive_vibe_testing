But he tells reporters that if the deal was what it appears to be, the lawmakers made a big mistake. It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which we give to other poor countries, whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people-to-people contacts between Americans and Cubans. The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill, came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of Cuba. The measure would allow American food and medicine to be sold there for the first time in close to 40 years. It also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted, Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. But Cuban-American house members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on President Castro demanded concessions. So, as Mr. Clinton noted, the plan bars American banks from financing the food sales, which means Havana would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries. Another part of the legislation would tighten restrictions on American travel to Cuba

But in the case of Cuba, the bill would place severe restrictions on financing, prohibiting both U.S. banks and the government from extending credit or loans. Cuba, a poor country, would have to either pay in cash or secure a loan from a foreign bank, probably at high interest rates. The proposal would also turn into law existing regulations that bar American tourists, among others, from visiting Cuba. Farmers, agribusiness and pharmaceutical companies had lobbied heavily for opening these markets in Cuba and the other countries

Forty-years ago today, the US reacted to the seizure of US owned assets by the Cuban government of Fidel Castro by applying a trade embargo on Cuba. Over time Washington has made changes to the sanctions sometimes making them more stringent, other times easing them to allow increased personal and business contacts. Wednesday, Congress passed and sent to President Clinton a new legislation that again modifies the sanctions. Mr. Clinton has said he will sign the legislation, but the basic restrictions remain in place, a symbol of US opposition to the Castro regime

Florida Republican Lincoln Dias Ballard represents the Cuban-American community in Miami, where support for the sanctions is strong. When the House and Senate voted separately earlier this year to lift the ban on sales of food and medicine, Mr. Dias Ballard went into action. Along with like-minded colleagues in the legislature, he convinced House Republican leaders to change the bill in negotiations with the Senate. The result is a very different measure. The compromise authorizes sales of United States agricultural commodities to the Cuban regime, but without American financing. Technically, the bill ends all US food and medicine embargoes now in effect against Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Iran, but Cuba is singled out. The cash-strapped Cubans have permission to buy the goods, but they can't obtain credit in the United States. The bill also puts into US law current restrictions on travel to Cuba, depriving the Castro government of American tourist revenues

Clinton, who said he was

really help farmers. ``What I have been told,'' he said, ``is it looks
like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't
very much, because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which
we give to other poor countries.'' ``It certainly restricts in, I
think, a completely unwarranted way,'' he added, ``the ability of
the United States to make travel decisions on policy that I do not
believe should be made, written in law, in stone by the Congress.
I think it's wrong.''
